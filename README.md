Music Player for Remote devices.

This is a start for using Alsaplayer to make it work with Raspberry Pi and make a simple API that could share status and perform operations like play, pause, navigation, etc.

We need following things:

1. alsaplayer Github repo for python module
1. libboost for building python module
1. libalsaplayer-dev
