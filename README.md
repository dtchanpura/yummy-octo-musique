# Yummy Octo Musique

Music Player for Remote devices.

This is a start for using Alsaplayer to make it work with Raspberry Pi and make a simple API that could share status and perform operations like play, pause, navigation, etc.

Right now it is using simple commands to control the alsaplayer in terminal but it needs to add following things in future:

1. alsaplayer Github repo for python module
1. libboost for building python module


Services:

/start No arguments or JSON
    To Start the alsaplayer daemon

/play No arguments or JSON
    To start playing
